Suppose you set up a pizza selling business. As you want your customer to have options, you give the customer the choice to choose the base and toppings.

Customer chooses one base and a lot of toppings. For instance, the base is Margherita and customer chooses extra cheese, jalapeno, and paneer. The toppings can be of any number of combinations.
So if we just create a class for each combination of toppings, it'd be n! topping combinations (or more than that, not sure) which will lead to class explosion.

How do we get out of this?
