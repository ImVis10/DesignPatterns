PLEASE GO THROUGH THE CODE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.

As we can see, eventhough we're extending the base class Car in all the other class, we're duplicating the code of the drive() in almost all the classes as the implementation is different from the parent in most of the child classes.

This increases duplication of code and as the number of classes increase, as the features get more complex, it'd be difficult to maintain the code.
